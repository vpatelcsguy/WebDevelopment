                         <p>Our department, together with the SIUE campus,
                          provides excellent facilities and many opportunities
                           for innovative biological study. In 2013 the department
                            moved into Science Lab West, a modern science education 
                            facility with well-appointed teaching and research labs.
                             The department is equipped with state-of-the-art technology

                               genetics, and toxicology research, and has extensive botanical 
                               and zoological teaching collections.</p>
