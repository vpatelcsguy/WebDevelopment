        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Tutoring Resource Center is to help students succeed in their courses in a supportive learning environment. We are located in the Student Success Center 1252 and open Monday through Sunday. Students who need assistance with their SIUE courses are welcome on a walk-in basis. Individual and small group tutoring is available without an appointment. Handouts, computer software (Mathematica, Matlab, SPSS) and calculators also are available.
